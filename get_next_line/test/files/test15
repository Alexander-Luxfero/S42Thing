In a garden lush with vibrant hues,  
Dreams awaken with the morning dew.  
Petals soft like whispers of the past,  
Natureâ€™s canvas, a portrait so vast.  

Breezes carry secrets held in the leaves,  
Stories linger in the rustling trees.  
As sunlight dances on the glistening ground,  
In each heartbeat of life, beauty is found.  

Time flows gently, a river of grace,  
In this sacred, tranquil space.  
A symphony played by the skies and earth,  
In every moment, a reminder of worth.
